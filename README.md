# ECAssignments

Project Experiments done for COMP-6660 Evolutionary Computing. Course was taught by Dr. Daniel Tauritz (https://bonsai.auburn.edu/dtauritz/) at Auburn University.

## Project List

### 1. bridge1a
  - Implementing a random search algorithm which generates bridges by uniform random placement of coordinates within a predefined rectangular area.
  
### 2. bridge1b
  - Implement a basic Evolutionary Algorithm which generates bridges and outperforms the random search algorithm from bridge1a by a signifcant statistcal amount.
  
### 3. bridge1c
  - Build upon the Evolutionary Algorithm from bridge1b to create two new Evolutionary Algorithms. The first EA is a constraint satisfaction that considers a new design constraint for allowing boats and other traffic to pass through the bridge. The second new EA is a multi-objective EA (MOEA) that considers both the weight your bridge can support and the total length of material needed to construct the bridge.
  
### 4. bridge1d
  - Using the EAs created in bridge1b and bridge1c, implement an island-model EA.
  
### 5. gpac2a
  - Implement a random search through valid parse tree space for Pac-Man controllers in GPac, a simplified Pac Man game.
  
### 6. gpac2b
  - Evolve a Genetic Programming tree controller for Pac-Man which generates the most high-quality valid action out of the 5 possible actions for Pac-Man that it can find.

### 7. gpac2c
  - Perform co-evolve within a configurable number of fitness evaluations, a Genetic Programming controller for Pac-Man and a Genetic Programming controller for all Ghosts where a single fitness evaluation is counted as a single full game played between competing controllers.
